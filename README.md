# DeReK: Deep Recursive Koopman for Nonlinear System Identification

## Overview

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for the publication titled **"Deep Dictionary-Free Method for Identifying Linear Model of Nonlinear System with Input Delay"**. The paper discusses the application of the Koopman theory and LSTM in system identification, providing mathematical definitions, methodologies, and case studies.

## Code TODOS

* @PV add deps to requirements.txt (your fork of neuromancer, etc.)
* @PV ensure runability of the code

## Paper TODOS

* see multiple "%%MKL" in tex source
'
## Future recommendations

* general suggested labeling in LaTeX: `env_identificator:chapter_label:section_label:actual_label:sub_actual_label`
  * in conference papers: `env_identificator:section_label:actual_label`
  * in subequations/align: `eq:section_label:actual_label` in main environment and then `eq:section_label:actual_label:label_of_individual_eq`

  abstract  = {The present paper treats the identification of nonlinear dynamical systems using Koopman-based deep state-space encoders. Through this method, the usual drawback of needing to choose a dictionary of lifting functions a priori is circumvented. The encoder represents the lifting function to the space where the dynamics are linearly propagated using the Koopman operator. An input-affine formulation is considered for the lifted model structure and we address both full and partial state availability. The approach is implemented using the the deepSI toolbox in Python. To lower the computational need of the simulation error-based training, the data is split into subsections where multi-step prediction errors are calculated independently. This formulation allows for efficient batch optimization of the network parameters and, at the same time, excellent long term prediction capabilities of the obtained models. The performance of the approach is illustrated by nonlinear benchmark examples.},

The correlations between the incremental input and different delayed output were computed and the delayed time corresponding to the maximum correlation was identified as the time-delay.

  abstract = {Identifying coordinate transformations that make strongly nonlinear dynamics approximately linear has the potential to enable nonlinear prediction, estimation, and control using linear theory. The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.},

  abstract  = {We exploit the key idea that nonlinear system identification is equivalent to linear identification of the so-called Koopman operator. Instead of considering nonlinear system identification in the state space, we obtain a novel linear identification technique by recasting the problem in the infinite-dimensional space of observables. This technique can be described in two main steps. In the first step, similar to a component of the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithm, the data are lifted to the infinite-dimensional space and used for linear identification of the Koopman operator. In the second step, the obtained Koopman operator is “projected back” to the finite-dimensional state space, and identified to the nonlinear vector field through a linear least squares problem. The proposed technique is efficient to recover (polynomial) vector fields of different classes of systems, including unstable, chaotic, and open systems. In addition, it is robust to noise, well-suited to model low sampling rate datasets, and able to infer network topology and dynamics.},

We first compare invariant measures and discuss this in terms of a “statistical Takens” theorem proved here. We also identify the need to go beyond comparing only invariant ergodic measures of systems and introduce an ergodic–theoretic treatment of a class of spectral functionals that allow for this. The formalism is extended for a class of stochastic systems: discrete Random Dynamical Systems. The ideas introduced in this paper can be used for parameter identification and model validation of driven nonlinear models with complicated behavior. As an illustration we provide an example in which we compare the asymptotic behavior of a combustion system measured experimentally with the asymptotic behavior of a class of models that have the form of a random dynamical system.},

@article{Mezić2005,
  abstract = {In this paper we discuss two issues related to model reduction of deterministic or stochastic processes. The first is the relationship of the spectral properties of the dynamics on the attractor of the original, high-dimensional dynamical system with the properties and possibilities for model reduction. We review some elements of the spectral theory of dynamical systems. We apply this theory to obtain a decomposition of the process that utilizes spectral properties of the linear Koopman operator associated with the asymptotic dynamics on the attractor. This allows us to extract the almost periodic part of the evolving process. The remainder of the process has continuous spectrum. The second topic we discuss is that of model validation, where the original, possibly high-dimensional dynamics and the dynamics of the reduced model -- that can be deterministic or stochastic -- are compared in some norm. Using the ``statistical Takens theorem'' proven in (Mezi{\'{c}}, I. and Banaszuk, A. Physica D, 2004) we argue that comparison of average energy contained in the finite-dimensional projection is one in the hierarchy of functionals of the field that need to be checked in order to assess the accuracy of the projection.},

@article{shi2022deep,
  abstract = {Recently Koopman operator has become a promising data-driven tool to facilitate real-time control for unknown nonlinear systems. It maps nonlinear systems into equivalent linear systems in embedding space, ready for real-time linear control methods. However, designing an appropriate Koopman embedding function remains a challenging task. Furthermore, most Koopman-based algorithms only consider nonlinear systems with linear control input, resulting in lousy prediction and control performance when the system is fully nonlinear with the control input. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework to learn the Koopman embedding function and Koopman Operator together to alleviate such difficulties. We first parameterize the embedding function and Koopman Operator with the neural network and train them end-to-end with the K-steps loss function. Then, an auxiliary control network is augmented to encode the nonlinear state-dependent control term to model the nonlinearity in the control input. This encoded term is considered the new control variable instead to ensure linearity of the modeled system in the embedding system. We next deploy Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) on the linear embedding space to derive the optimal control policy and decode the actual control input from the control net. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other existing methods, reducing the prediction error by order of magnitude and achieving superior control performance in several nonlinear dynamic systems like damping pendulum, CartPole, and the seven DOF robotic manipulator.},

  abstract = { Abstract. Koopman analysis provides a general theoretical underpinning for widely used dynamic mode decomposition algorithms which approximate the behavior of a nonlinear dynamical system using a linear operator. While such methods have proven to be remarkably useful in the analysis of time-series data, the resulting linear models must generally be of high order to accurately approximate fundamentally nonlinear behaviors. This issue poses an inherent risk of overfitting to training data, thereby limiting predictive capabilities. By contrast, this work explores strategies for nonlinear data-driven system identification using strategies inspired by Koopman analysis. General strategies that yield nonlinear models are presented for systems both with and without control. Subsequent projection of the resulting nonlinear equations onto a low-rank basis yields a low-order representation for the underlying dynamical system. In both computational and experimental examples considered in this work, linear estimators of the Koopman operator are generally only able to provide short-term predictions for the observable dynamics, while comparable nonlinear estimators for the system dynamics provide accurate predictions on substantially longer timescales and replicate infinite-time behaviors that linear predictors cannot. },

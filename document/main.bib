  abstract = {A time-delay identification algorithm in closed-loop dynamic processes with disturbance based on maximum correlation analysis was proposed in this paper. To denoise the output data, the response of process disturbance was first estimated on routine data and then eliminated from the output. Next the incremental denoising process data were proposed to be used against the influence of system dynamic on the time-delay estimation. The correlations between the incremental input and different delayed output were computed and the delayed time corresponding to the maximum correlation was identified as the time-delay. The application in the Wood-Berry process and an industrial process showed the validity of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {A state-space realization approach is presented for the identification of time-delay dynamic systems. It is proposed an experiment with low complexity input signals such as the double pulse. The proposed identification method is a generalization of the Ho-Kalman-Kung technique for pulsed input signals. Due to its state-space formulation, it is essentially suitable to both SISO and MIMO systems.},

@article{Lusch2018,
  abstract = {Identifying coordinate transformations that make strongly nonlinear dynamics approximately linear has the potential to enable nonlinear prediction, estimation, and control using linear theory. The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.},

@article{Mezic2004101,
  abstract = {We present a formalism for comparing the asymptotic dynamics of dynamical systems with physical systems that they model based on the spectral properties of the Koopman operator. We first compare invariant measures and discuss this in terms of a “statistical Takens” theorem proved here. We also identify the need to go beyond comparing only invariant ergodic measures of systems and introduce an ergodic–theoretic treatment of a class of spectral functionals that allow for this. The formalism is extended for a class of stochastic systems: discrete Random Dynamical Systems. The ideas introduced in this paper can be used for parameter identification and model validation of driven nonlinear models with complicated behavior. As an illustration we provide an example in which we compare the asymptotic behavior of a combustion system measured experimentally with the asymptotic behavior of a class of models that have the form of a random dynamical system.},

@article{Mezić2005,
  abstract = {In this paper we discuss two issues related to model reduction of deterministic or stochastic processes. The first is the relationship of the spectral properties of the dynamics on the attractor of the original, high-dimensional dynamical system with the properties and possibilities for model reduction. We review some elements of the spectral theory of dynamical systems. We apply this theory to obtain a decomposition of the process that utilizes spectral properties of the linear Koopman operator associated with the asymptotic dynamics on the attractor. This allows us to extract the almost periodic part of the evolving process. The remainder of the process has continuous spectrum. The second topic we discuss is that of model validation, where the original, possibly high-dimensional dynamics and the dynamics of the reduced model -- that can be deterministic or stochastic -- are compared in some norm. Using the ``statistical Takens theorem'' proven in (Mezi{\'{c}}, I. and Banaszuk, A. Physica D, 2004) we argue that comparison of average energy contained in the finite-dimensional projection is one in the hierarchy of functionals of the field that need to be checked in order to assess the accuracy of the projection.},
